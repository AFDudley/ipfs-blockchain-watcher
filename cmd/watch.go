A watcher is composed of four parts:
1) Go execution engine- this command- which fetches raw chain data and adds it to the Postres queued ready data tables
2) TOML config file which specifies what subset of chain data to fetch and from where and contains references to the below
3) Set of WASM binaries which are loaded into Postgres and used by
4) Set of PostgreSQL trigger functions which automatically act on data as it is inserted into the queued ready data tables`,
